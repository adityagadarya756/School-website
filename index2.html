<h2>Principal's <span>Message</span></h2>
<!--p><strong>"We can, we will, we must........"<br>
Our mind is set on it & nothing or no one will stop us......</strong><br><br>
I believe that there is nothing a human being cannot achieve, all one has to do is to be determined and focused. Right motivation, dedication, determination and diligence definitely pays off and leads to the achievement of the goals.<br><br>
According to me every child is important and every child is talented. The school provides opportunities for such talents to blossom & flourish ,and equips each learner to realize his/her full potential Competition and other co-curricular activities are organized from time to time to tap the hidden talent.<br><br-->
<p><strong>FROM PRINCIPALâ€™S DESK</strong></p><br><br>

<p>The etymology of the school came into existence in our country in very ancient times. The knowledge of
keeping the body healthy with the ashes of gold was given by the wise in our country in ancient times and we are verifying this truth again on the scale of science in the 21st century with the advent of nanotechnology. It shows that the flow of knowledge is   present from the beginning of the universe. That knowledge is of no use which would not work in the upliftment of the society and that behaviour would have been useless which would not create harmony in the society. Such children, who understand the true meaning of knowledge and behaviour and move forward with the same, are called responsible citizens of the future.<br><br></p>
